                            The “Early Intervention Program” aims to provide services for infants, toddlers and children up to the age of 5 years at risk for developmental delays. These services are designed to identify and meet children’s special needs in 5 main developmental areas, namely- physical, cognitive, communication, social or emotional development and sensory and adaptive development. <br/>
                            Resources, guidance and therapies such as Occupational, Physio, Speech, Aquatic, Equine therapy and Sensory Integration have shown great improvement in the children. They begin to talk, engage with one another and gradually grasp academic concepts like alphabets and numbers as well.
